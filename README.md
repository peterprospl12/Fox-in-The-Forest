# Unity - Fox in The forest

The project consists of designing and developing a 2D platformer game using the Unity and the Sunny Land asset pack.

The project was carried out in pairs. In our game, we implemented various game elements, such as: menu, HUD, logic puzzles, different elements of character and enemy mechanics, and objects moving in different ways. 
The game requires collecting keys to complete the level. 
After completing the level, the score (points are obtained for defeating enemies, collecting “cherries” and for each life that we managed to save) and the level completion time are shown. 

The HUD consists of a timer, number of lives, current score, and number of defeated enemies. The player can change the volume or graphics quality through the options.

Our game qualified for the final stage of the contest. The games that made it to the final were chosen based on the ratings of the students who tested each of the games.
